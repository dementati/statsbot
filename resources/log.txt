00:58 < meganomic> Hadn't seen my bathroom spider for a while. Took a shower. Then I saw him walking on the wall trying to get rid of all that water. Poor spider bro

09:22 < Wertilq> Yesterday I was just starring blankly being unable to follow conversations etc
09:22 < Wertilq> Now I am back to being human again

11:08 < kimbye> it's my nameday today, please give me cake
11:09 < Wertilq> therocode: your female have her name day, you need to bake her a cake!
11:12 < Wertilq> With extra marsipan!
11:12 < Wertilq> Jordgubbar!
11:13 < Wertilq> And SPRING!
11:13 < Wertilq> Put some flowers on it!
11:18 < Wertilq> And ballonger too!
11:19 < kimbye> hmm
11:19 < kimbye> I've eaten flowers before, but not balloons
11:20 < Wertilq> http://edibleballoonsgroup.ca/
11:20 < kimbye> lol
11:26 < Wertilq> I ate at Amazing Thai in Uppsala this weekend :D
11:26 < Wertilq> They had a chocolate fountain it was pretty amazing :D
11:27 < Wertilq> You could put some sweet bread in it and marshmallows
11:27 < Wertilq> Would've been awesome with fruits and berries too
11:28 -!- kimki [kim@Clk-8F6F513E.user.ki.se] has joined #pallkars
11:36 < Scarecrow> Wertilq: Hope the food wasn't spoiled so you become one too
11:36 < AliPasha> kimki: Oh, yes, happy nameday
11:36 < AliPasha> kimki: It's also today in the Finnish calendar
11:37 < Scarecrow> kimki: On your cake day, you get cake. On your nameday, you get a name.
11:39 <~therocode> Wertilq: cake on names day is for extravagant pricks!
11:39 <~therocode> https://www.badnorth.com/  this game looks cool :O
11:39 < Scarecrow> I'm so desensitized to cakes. You get cake all the time nowadays.
11:40 < Scarecrow> I had cake yesterday.
11:40 < AliPasha> therocode: Thus, name-day-cake is precisely your thing, yes? =P
11:40 < AliPasha> There was this apple-pie-sort-of-cake for dessert today
11:41 < Scarecrow> therocode: The aesthetic is very pleasant
11:47 < kimki> AliPasha: yayy thanks! is "kimmo" there too?
12:04 < AliPasha> kimki: No. It's Aki, Kim, Joakim
12:07 < kimki> interesting
12:08 < AliPasha> kimki: In the Finnish name statistics there are ~6340 men and ~500 women named Kim
12:09 < AliPasha> kimki: And 623 people whose surname is Kim
12:11 < kimki> I wonder if any of those numbers overlap, so that there's some people named Kim Kim
12:11 < kimki> kimkim
12:11 -!- kimbye is now known as kimkim
12:12 < AliPasha> That I can't say. Such would not be possible for people born in Finland, but could be possible for someone who's moved here
12:14 < kimki> how about if you marry someone with the last name Kim? how are marriage renaming things there? do women generally take on the husband's last name?
12:16 < jefvel> I want to be named mikke k. kim
12:16 < jefvel> of course the k. stands for kim
12:17 < jefvel> but it becomes a palindrome with k
12:17 < kimki> :D
12:17 < kimki> lol, that reminds me of something I heard yesterday -- my chinese colleagues have really common names
12:17 < kimki> so when they write publications, sometimes they add fake middle initials
12:17 < kimki> to not get mixed up with other authors
12:18 < jefvel> yung madafaka yung
12:18 < kimki> haha
12:19 < jefvel> why do scientific papers have like cross symbols after some of the author names sometimes?
12:19 < jefvel> I hope it's not because they're dead
12:19 < jefvel> oh
12:19 < jefvel> it's a dagger, not a cross
12:19 < jefvel> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(typography)
12:20 < kimki> haha
12:20 < kimki> yeah it's just a footnote thingy like an asterisk or number or whatever
12:21 < jefvel> might just use RIP as a footnote
12:21 < jefvel> Jonas Jonson††† 
12:21 < jefvel> ps han lever
12:25 < kimki> haha
12:25 < kimki> just kiddin gguys I'm not dead 
12:30 < AliPasha> kimki: Hmm, that is a good question. It is usual, but by no mean necessary (any more), for the woman to take the man's surname
13:12 < Scarecrow> Oh goodie
13:12 < Scarecrow> I'm gonna be on the same team as Patrik Lindefors
13:30 < meganomic> 13:30
13:34 < kimki> AliPasha: right, similar to sweden then I suppose
13:37 < kimki> 13:37
13:37 < jefvel> ††† Patrik † Lindefors †††
13:37 < jefvel> _-TuRbO-_-SlAyEr-_
13:39 < kimki> MAC addresses are unique and specific to the hardware, right?
13:39 < kimki> as in, they're the same no matter what OS you install or whatever
13:40 < jefvel> i think so
13:40 < jefvel> that is probably correct
13:40 < kimki> I agree
13:40 < jefvel> you're my favourite customer
13:40 < jefvel> o hai dogy
13:41 < kimki> lol, I told my supervisor to watch that movie
13:41 < kimki> and he was like "it was so bad"
13:41 < kimki> and not even in a "so bad it's good" way
13:41 < kimki> he just hated it
13:41 < kimki> haha
13:42 < jefvel> haha, it's a risky movie to recommend
13:42 < jefvel> you need that special trash mindset to appreciate it
13:43 < kimki> haha yeah
13:43 < jefvel> I think I got beerborne aids this weekend
13:43 < kimki> we are special trash :)
13:43 < kimki> oh, that sounds lovely
13:43 < jefvel> yep, this is special trash united 
13:44 < jefvel> good thing I can work from home, because I feel too sick to go out but not too sick to get something done
13:46 < Wertilq> Scarecrow: congratulations :D
13:47 < Wertilq> May your workdays be interesting :D
13:47 < jefvel> I hate UIs that don't have a manual refresh button
13:47 < Wertilq> Your tickets will be stuff like "change all 'if' into 'case'"
13:48 < Wertilq> and "Add comments praising Lord Lindefors in all files"
13:48 < kimki> jefvel: you can just drag the screen down like on phone apps
13:48 < kimki> just pull your monitor down onto the floor
13:48 < kimki> throw it for best effect
13:48 < jefvel> yeah, but some apps don't even have that
13:48 < jefvel> like spotify
13:48 < jefvel> spotify has podcasts now, and there's a podcast list
13:48 < jefvel> and you never know if it's been updated with the newest stuff
13:49 < jefvel> so I have to restart spotify to be sure
13:49 < kimki> aha
13:49 < jefvel> just let me f5, it's an electron app after all
13:50 < jefvel> also the tieto project has a guideline that was something like "we don't like manual refresh, so please remove refresh buttons"
13:50 < kimki> aparently it's not actually electron :o
13:50 < jefvel> it isn't?
13:51 < kimki> oh, it's still chromium though
13:51 < kimki> the second answer is from a real spotfiy person https://www.quora.com/How-did-Spotify-make-a-multiplatform-lightweight-well-designed-desktop-application-What-is-the-technology-behind-it
13:51 < jefvel> yeah still web based, but the stuff behind the scenes is c++
13:52 < kimki> yep
13:52 < jefvel> hey I read that same one wow
13:52 < kimki> omg are we related
13:53 < jefvel> its me ur brother
13:55 < kimki> electron is nice but poopbloat
13:57 < Scarecrow> Wertilq: Good times
14:01 < Scarecrow> Yay, I wrote a shell function to query any table in any running server's database through our database's REST API
14:01 < Scarecrow> So I just type "query_cdb RE1P BespokeCalculationResults" and I get the contents of that database table in that server in formatted JSON to the terminal
14:09 < meganomic> nice
14:17 < meganomic> kimki: "Well designed", fail. I still remember the old version with 2 times the functionality
14:19 < kimki> haha
14:19 < kimki> I've only started using it recently, so
14:19 < meganomic> =)
14:38 < jefvel> heh, that guy who made the nazi pug video has been convicted, and might go to jail for causing a mass offence 
14:41 < kimki> :|
14:44 < jefvel> https://twitter.com/CountDankulaTV/status/832770533758349312 haha
14:48 < kimki> haha, glad he's being cool about it
14:52 < kimki> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYRSxaqWsAkRXg5.jpg:large loll
14:56 < jefvel> lmaoooasdfadgasdf
14:59 < kimki> tack för stödet!
14:59 < kimki> I feel like I'm the only person talking in this channel today
14:59 < kimki> hello hello hello
15:00 < Scarecrow> Is there any way to dump the current irssi log for a channel to file?
15:00 < Scarecrow> I mean, the scrollback
15:01 < kimki> dunno, I just have logs on I guess and would just copy the log file from the current day or something
15:01 < kimki> did you want something in particular_
15:01 < kimki> ?*
15:01 < Scarecrow> kimki: I'm gonna analyze to what extent you're the only person talking in this channel today
15:02 < jefvel> ah
15:02 < jefvel> that is a very important thing to do
15:02 < kimki> lol
15:02 < Scarecrow> I am very important and doing very important things all the time
